This is a child project of Tiramisu Transit LLC/app.
This is a machine learning effort to predict the bus stop(s) potential bus riders want to look up in Tiramisu a transit app. This prediction will be used to automate the bus stop picking and thus minimize the user map navigation efforts required for the app. We mined the Tiramisu call log data of 2014 spring Pittsburgh to build a 3-fold global prediction model as well as personalized models.
